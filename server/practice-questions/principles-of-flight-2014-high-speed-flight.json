      "question": "An all moving tailplane is used in preference to elevators on high speed aircraft:",
      "options": [
        "because the effect of the elevator is reversed above the critical Mach number.",
        "because shock wave formation on the elevator causes excessive stick forces.",

        "because it would be physically impossible for a pilot to control the aircraft in pitch with a conventional tailplane and elevator configuration."
      ],
      "answer": "c",
