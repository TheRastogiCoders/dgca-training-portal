      "question": "Take-off EPR is being delivered by all engines and the take-off is proceeding normally, the undercarriage has just retracted. Which initial indications may be observed when a headwind shears to a downdraught?",
      "options": [
        "Indicated Airspeed: constant. Vertical Speed: decreases. Pitch Attitude: decreases.",
        "Indicated Airspeed: increases. Vertical Speed: decreases. Pitch Attitude: constant.",
        "Indicated Airspeed: decreases. Vertical Speed: constant. Pitch Attitude: constant.",
        "Indicated Airspeed: decreases. Vertical Speed: decreases. Pitch Attitude: decreases."
      ],
      "answer": "d",
      "explanation": "A shear from headwind to downdraught removes lift energy, leading to initial loss of airspeed and vertical speed accompanied by a decreasing pitch."
    },
    {
      "id": "pof2014-14-2",
      "question": "Maximum downdraughts in a microburst encounter may be as strong as:",
      "options": [
        "6 000 ft/min.",
        "7 000 ft/min.",
        "8 000 ft/min.",
        "10 000 ft/min."
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Microburst downdraughts commonly reach 6 000–8 000 ft/min; 8 000 ft/min represents the typical extreme quoted for training materials."

      "id": "pof2014-14-3",
      "question": "An aircraft that encounters a headwind of 45 knots, within a microburst, may expect a total shear across the microburst of:",
      "options": [
        "80 kt.",
        "40 kt.",
        "90 kt.",
        "45 kt."
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Microbursts can reverse the wind from headwind to tailwind; 45 kt headwind plus 45 kt tailwind change results in about 90 kt total shear."
    },
    {
      "id": "pof2014-14-4",
      "question": "What is the expected duration of an individual microburst?",
      "options": [
        "Two minutes with maximum winds lasting approximately 1 minute.",
        "Seldom longer than 15 minutes from the time the burst strikes the ground until dissipation.",
        "One microburst may continue for as long as 2 to 4 hours.",
        "For as long as 1 hour."
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Microbursts are short-lived phenomena; typically the hazardous winds last less than 15 minutes."

        "Decreasing headwind or tailwind.",
        "Increasing headwind and decreasing tailwind.",
        "Decreasing headwind and increasing tailwind.",
        "Increasing headwind or tailwind."
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Losing headwind or gaining tailwind removes kinetic energy from the wing, causing an airspeed drop."
    },
    {
      "id": "pof2014-14-6",
      "question": "Which performance characteristics should be recognized during take-off when encountering a tailwind shear that increases in intensity?",
      "options": [
        "Loss of, or diminished climb ability.",
        "Increased climb performance immediately after take-off.",
        "Decreased take-off distance.",
        "Improved ability to climb."
      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "An increasing tailwind reduces relative airflow, lowering lift and climb performance."

        "Calm wind which suddenly shears to a tailwind."
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A rapid increase in headwind is an energy gain: airspeed rises, pitch tends to increase, and sink rate reduces."

      "question": "Which initial cockpit indications should a pilot be aware of when a constant tailwind shears to a calm wind?",
      "options": [
        "Altitude increases; pitch and indicated airspeed decrease.",
        "Altitude, pitch, and indicated airspeed increase.",
        "Altitude, pitch, and indicated airspeed decrease.",
        "Altitude decreases; pitch and indicated airspeed increase."
      ],
      "answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Losing tailwind is an energy gain similar to increasing headwind: IAS and pitch rise and the aircraft tends to climb initially."

        "Accelerate the aircraft to prevent a stall by sacrificing altitude."
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Standard windshear recovery calls for maximum available thrust, pitch toward stick shaker/initial buffet, and avoiding configuration changes."

      "question": "Which of the following would be acceptable techniques to minimize the effects of a windshear encounter?\n1. To prevent damage to the engines, avoid the use of maximum available thrust.\n2. Increase the pitch angle until the stick shaker activates, then decrease back-pressure to maintain that angle of pitch.\n3. Maintain a constant airspeed.\n4. Use maximum power available as soon as possible.\n5. Keep to noise abatement procedures.\n6. Wait until the situation resolves itself before taking any action.",

        "2 and 4."
      ],
      "answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Approved recovery uses maximum thrust promptly and pitches toward stick shaker; noise procedures or holding back power are inappropriate."

    {
      "id": "pof2014-14-11",
      "question": "Which of the following statements about windshear is true?\n1. Windshear can subject your aircraft to sudden updraughts, downdraughts, or extreme horizontal wind components.\n2. Windshear will cause abrupt displacement from the flight path and require substantial control action to counteract it.\n3. Windshear only affects small single and twin engine aircraft. Large, modern, powerful, fast gas turbine engine powered aircraft will not suffer from the worst effects of a microburst.\n4. Microbursts are associated with cumulonimbus clouds.\n5. Windshear can strike suddenly and with devastating effect which has been beyond the recovery powers of experienced pilots flying modern and powerful aircraft.",

      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correct; statement 3 is false because all aircraft types are vulnerable."

    {
      "id": "pof2014-14-12",
      "question": "A microburst is one of the most dangerous sources of windshear associated with thunderstorms. They are:",
      "options": [
        "small-scale intense updraughts, which suck warm moist air into the cumulonimbus cloud.",
        "small-scale shafts of violent rain, which can cause severe problems to gas turbine engines.",
        "large-scale, violent air, associated with air descending from the 'anvil' of a thunder cloud.",
        "small-scale (typically less than 1 mile in diameter) intense downdraughts which, on reaching the surface, spread outward in all directions from the downdraught centre."
      ],
      "answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Microbursts are compact downdraughts spreading outwards at ground level, creating severe divergent winds."

    {
      "id": "pof2014-14-13",
      "question": "Thrust is being managed to maintain desired indicated airspeed and the glide slope is being flown. Which of the following is the recommended procedure when you observe a 30 kt loss of airspeed and the descent rate increases from 750 ft/min to 2 000 ft/min?",
      "options": [
        "Increase power to regain lost airspeed and pitch-up to regain the glide slope - continue the approach and continue to monitor your flight instruments.",
        "Decrease the pitch attitude to regain airspeed and then fly-up to regain the glide slope.",
        "Apply full power and execute a go-around; report windshear to ATC as soon as practicable.",
        "Wait until the airspeed stabilizes and the rate of descent decreases, because microbursts are quite small and you will soon fly out of it."
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Such a large loss of airspeed and increased sink rate on approach indicates windshear; immediate go-around with maximum thrust is required."
