      "question": "As a result of gyroscopic precession, it can be said that:",
      "options": [
        "any pitching around the longitudinal axis results in a yawing moment.",
        "any yawing around the normal axis results in a pitching moment.",
        "any pitching around the lateral axis results in a rolling moment.",
        "any rolling around the longitudinal axis results in a pitching moment."
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Deflecting the propeller disc in yaw produces a reaction 90° in the plane of rotation, giving a pitching couple."

    {
      "id": "pof2014-15-3",
      "question": "The reason for variations in geometric pitch (twisting) along a propeller blade is that it:",

      "question": "Which statement best describes the operating principle of a constant speed propeller?",
      "options": [
        "As throttle setting is changed by the pilot, the prop governor causes pitch angle of the propeller blades to remain unchanged.",
        "The propeller control regulates the engine RPM and in turn the propeller RPM.",
        "A high blade angle, or increased pitch, reduces the propeller drag and allows more engine power for takeoffs.",
        "As the propeller control setting is changed by the pilot, the RPM of the engines remains constant as the pitch angle of the propeller changes."
