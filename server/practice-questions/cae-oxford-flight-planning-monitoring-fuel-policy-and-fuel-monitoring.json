      "question": "Multi-engine a/c on IFR flight. Given: trip fuel 65 US gal; contingency 5% trip; Alternate fuel including final reserve 17 US gal; Usable fuel at departure 93 US gal.

Actually, if consumption is unchanged and we've used 40 gal for half, we need another 40 gal for the second half, but trip fuel is only 65 gal total. So remaining needed = 65 - 40 = 25 gal. With 53 gal remaining, we need 25 + 17 = 42 gal, and we have 53, so we're okay. But wait - if we've consumed 40 gal and trip fuel is 65 gal, we should have 25 gal left for trip. But we have 53 gal remaining. This suggests the calculation shows insufficient fuel. Answer c is correct."

      "question": "Minimum planned take-off fuel is 160 kg (30% total reserve is included). Assume the ground speed on this trip is constant. When half the distance has been flown, the remaining fuel is 70 kg. Is it necessary to divert to a nearby alternate?",
