      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "a. the air is usually at low temperatures containing little water vapour",
        "b. turbulence steepens the lapse rate producing an inversion above the friction layer",
        "c. air is not allowed to remain in contact with the surface due to the strong wind thus maintaining cool surface air with warm air above",

        "a. The pressure gradient is greatest towards the centre of the anticyclone",
        "b. Anticyclones are more common in winter than they are in summer. This is why radiation fog is much more frequent in the winter",
