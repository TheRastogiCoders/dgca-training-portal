      "answer": "a",

      "explanation": "OBS set to 330° with FROM indication means the aircraft is on the 330° radial. QDM (magnetic bearing to station) = 330° - 180° = 150°. However, with 3 dots fly right, the aircraft is actually on a radial slightly less than 330°. Each dot = 2°, so 3 dots = 6°. Actual radial ≈ 330° - 6° = 324°, so QDM ≈ 324° - 180° = 144°."

      "answer": "d",
      "solution": "d",
      "explanation": "UK airways are 10 NM wide (5 NM either side). At 100 NM distance, 5 NM off centerline = 5/100 = 0.05 radians = 2.86°. With 1 dot = 2°, this is approximately 1.5 dots deflection."

      "answer": "a",
      "solution": "a",

      "answer": "c",
      "solution": "C",
      "explanation": "4 dots fly right with TO indication means the aircraft is left of the desired radial. At 45 NM, 1 dot = 2° = 45 × 2 × π/180 ≈ 1.57 NM. 4 dots = 4 × 1.57 ≈ 6.3 NM. Since fly right is indicated, the aircraft is 6 NM left of track."

      "explanation": "NDB bearings are affected by the magnetic field at the aircraft position (where the bearing is measured), so variation at aircraft position applies. VOR radials are magnetic bearings from the beacon, so variation at the beacon position applies."
