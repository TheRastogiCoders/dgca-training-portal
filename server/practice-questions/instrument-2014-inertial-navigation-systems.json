      "question": "INS errors are classified as \"bounded errors\" and \"unbounded errors\".",
      "options": [
        "a. An \"unbounded error\" is an error that increases with time, an example being the distance gone error due to a ground speed error",
        "b. An \"unbounded error\" is an error that increases with time, an example being an increasing ground speed error due to the platform not being levelled correctly",
        "c. A \"bounded error\" is an error that is subject to sudden unpredictable random changes. Most notable during pitching manoeuvres and when raising or lowering flap and U/C",
        "d. A \"bounded error\" is an error that is \"tied\" to the real wander rates of the gyros on the platform"
