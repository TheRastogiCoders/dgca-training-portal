      "question": "An aircraft has to communicate with a VHF station at a range of 300 NM, if the ground station is situated 2500 ft AMSL which of the following is the lowest altitude at which contact is likely to be made?",
      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "a. 190 ft",
        "b. 1378 ft",
        "c. 36 100 ft",
        "d. 84 100 ft"
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "solution": "C",
      "explanation": "For line-of-sight VHF communication: range = 1.23 × (√h₁ + √h₂) where h is in feet. Given range = 300 NM and h₁ = 2500 ft, we solve: 300 = 1.23 × (√2500 + √h₂). √2500 = 50, so 300/1.23 ≈ 243.9 = 50 + √h₂, giving √h₂ ≈ 193.9, so h₂ ≈ 37,600 ft. The closest answer is 36,100 ft."

      "question": "Class 'B' VHF DF bearings are accurate to within:",

      "options": [
        "a. ±1°",
        "b. ±5°",

      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "solution": "b",
      "explanation": "VHF Direction Finder (VDF) bearings are classified by accuracy. Class 'B' bearings have an accuracy of ±5°. Class 'A' bearings are more accurate (±2°), while lower classes have less accuracy."

      "question": "A VDF QDM given without an accuracy classification may be assumed to be accurate to within:",
      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "a. 2 degrees",
        "b. 5 degrees",
        "c. 7.5 degrees",
        "d. 10 degrees"
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "solution": "b",
      "explanation": "When a VDF QDM (magnetic bearing to the station) is given without an accuracy classification, it should be assumed to have an accuracy of ±5 degrees. This is the standard assumption for unclassified VDF bearings."

      "question": "An aircraft at altitude 9000 ft wishes to communicate with a VHF/DF station that is situated at 400 ft AMSL. What is the maximum range at which contact is likely to be made?",

      "answer": "c",
      "solution": "C",
      "explanation": "For line-of-sight VHF communication: range = 1.23 × (√h₁ + √h₂). With h₁ = 9000 ft and h₂ = 400 ft: range = 1.23 × (√9000 + √400) = 1.23 × (94.9 + 20) = 1.23 × 114.9 ≈ 141.3 NM. The closest answer is 143 NM."

      "question_type": "MCQ",

        "a. QDM is 345° ±5°",

        "d. QUJ is 353° ±2°"
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "solution": "C",
      "explanation": "QTE is the true bearing from the station to the aircraft. The aircraft is passed a true bearing of 353°, which is the QTE (true bearing from station). With variation 8°E, the magnetic bearing would be 353° - 8° = 345° (QDM). However, since the bearing is classified as 'B', the accuracy is ±5°. The question asks about the true bearing (QTE), which is 353° ±5°."

      "explanation": "For line-of-sight VHF communication: range = 1.23 × (√h₁ + √h₂). With h₁ = 19000 ft and h₂ = 1400 ft: range = 1.23 × (√19000 + √1400) = 1.23 × (137.8 + 37.4) = 1.23 × 175.2 ≈ 215.5 NM. The closest answer is 219 NM."
