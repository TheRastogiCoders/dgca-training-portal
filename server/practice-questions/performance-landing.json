      "question": "The approach climb requirement has been established to ensure:",
      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "a. minimum climb gradient in case of a go-around with one engine inoperative",
        "b. obstacle clearance in the approach area",
        "c. manoeuvrability in case of landing with one engine inoperative",
        "d. manoeuvrability during approach with full flaps and gear down, all engines operating"
      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "solution": "a",
      "explanation": "The approach climb requirement ensures that the aircraft can achieve a minimum climb gradient in case of a go-around with one engine inoperative. This is a critical safety requirement that ensures the aircraft can safely abort a landing and climb away from the runway and surrounding obstacles even with reduced power."

      "answer": "b",
      "solution": "b",
      "explanation": "The maximum mass for landing could be limited by the climb requirements with one engine inoperative in the approach configuration. This ensures that if a go-around is necessary during approach, the aircraft can safely climb away with one engine failed."

      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "solution": "c",
      "explanation": "According to EU-OPS regulations for turbo-propeller powered aeroplanes not performing a steep approach, the maximum landing distance at the destination aerodrome and at any alternate aerodrome is 0.7 x LDA (landing distance available).

      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "solution": "c",
      "explanation": "For turboprop aircraft, wet landing distance = dry landing distance × 1.15 (15% increase). Maximum wet landing distance = 0.7 × 2200 m = 1540 m. Therefore, maximum dry landing distance = 1540 m ÷ 1.15 = 1339 m."
