      "question": "A pitot head is used to measure:",
      "options": [
        "a. dynamic minus static pressure",
        "b. static plus dynamic pressure",
        "c. static pressure",
        "d. dynamic pressure"
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "A pitot head measures total pressure, which is the sum of static pressure and dynamic pressure (Pt = Ps + q)."
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "question": "A static vent is used to measure:",
      "options": [
        "a. dynamic pressure minus static pressure",
        "b. dynamic pressure plus static pressure",
        "c. atmospheric pressure",
        "d. dynamic pressure"
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "A static vent measures atmospheric (static) pressure, which is the ambient air pressure at the aircraft's altitude."
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "question": "A pressure head is subject to the following errors:",
      "options": [
        "a. position, manoeuvre-induced, temperature",
        "b. position, manoeuvre-induced",
        "c. position, manoeuvre-induced, density",
        "d. position, manoeuvre-induced, instrument"
      ],
      "answer": "d",
      "explanation": "Pressure heads are subject to position error (due to aircraft attitude and airflow), manoeuvre-induced error (during turns, climbs, descents), and instrument error (mechanical inaccuracies)."
    },
    {
      "id": "4",
      "question": "Given:\n$Pt=$ total pressure\n$Ps=$ static pressure\nDynamic pressure is:",
      "options": [
        "a. $Pt-Ps$",
        "b. $(Pt-Ps)/Pt$",
        "c. $(Pt-Ps)/Ps$",
        "d. $\\dot{Pt}/Ps$"
      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Dynamic pressure (q) is the difference between total pressure (Pt) and static pressure (Ps): q = Pt - Ps."
    },
    {
      "id": "5",
      "question": "Manoeuvre induced error:",
      "options": [
        "a. is caused by pressure changes at static probes or vents",
        "b. is likely to be greatest when yawing after engine failure",
        "c. is combined with instrument and position error on a correction card",
        "d. lasts for only a short time at high altitude"
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Manoeuvre-induced error occurs during aircraft manoeuvres and is particularly significant during yawing, such as after engine failure when asymmetric thrust causes yaw."
    },
    {
      "id": "6",
      "question": "Position error:",
      "options": [
        "a. may be reduced by the fitting of static vents",
        "b. will usually decrease with an increase in altitude",
        "c. will depend solely on the attitude of the aircraft",
        "d. will usually decrease as the aircraft approaches the speed of sound"
      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Position error can be reduced by properly positioning static vents in areas of undisturbed airflow, away from pressure fields created by the aircraft structure."
    },
    {
      "id": "7",
      "question": "Fitting static vents to both sides of the aircraft fuselage will:",
      "options": [
        "a. reduce the position error",
        "b. balance out errors caused by side-slipping or yawing",
        "c. require a calibration card for each static vent",
        "d. enable a greater number of instruments to be fitted"
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Dual static vents on both sides of the fuselage help balance out errors caused by sideslipping or yawing by averaging the pressure readings from both sides."
    },
    {
      "id": "8",
      "question": "Where an alternate static source is fitted, use of this source usually leads to:",
      "options": [
        "a. a temporary increase in lag error",
        "b. a lower pressure error than with normal sources",
        "c. an increase in position error",
        "d. no change in position error"
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Alternate static sources are typically located inside the cabin or cockpit, where pressure may differ from ambient static pressure, leading to increased position error."
