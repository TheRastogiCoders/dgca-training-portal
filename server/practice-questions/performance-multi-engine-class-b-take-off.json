      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "a. must not be less than the gross take-off distance to 50 ft",
        "b. must not be less than 1.15 times the gross take-off distance to 50 ft",
        "c. must not be less than 1.25 times the gross take-off distance to 50 ft",
        "d. must not be less than 1.3 times the gross take-off distance to 50 ft"
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "solution": "c",
      "explanation": "For a multi-engine Class B aeroplane at an aerodrome with no stopway or clearway, the take-off run available (TORA) must be at least 1.25 times the gross take-off distance to 50 ft. This provides a safety margin to account for variations in pilot technique, aircraft performance, and environmental conditions."

      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "solution": "a",
      "explanation": "For a multi-engine Class B aircraft, the rotation speed (VR) must not be less than either 1.1 times the stalling speed with one engine inoperative (V51) or 1.05 times the minimum control speed (VMC), whichever is greater. This ensures safe rotation and initial climb performance with one engine inoperative."

This ensures adequate safety margin for continued flight with one engine inoperative."

The accelerate-stop distance is determined by entering the chart with the given conditions: OAT 27°C, Pressure altitude MSL, Mass 3750 lb, Tailwind 5 kt, Flaps 25°, and reading the distance for abort speed 64 KIAS with 3 seconds reaction time."

        "d. 3000 lb"
      ],
      "answer": null,
      "solution": null,
      "explanation": "This question requires the use of Performance Manual CAP 698 MEP1 Figure 3.2.

      "question": "For this question use Figure 3.2 in CAP 698. With regard to the graph for the light twin aeroplane, will the accelerate-stop distance be achieved in a take-off where the brakes are released before take-off power is set?",
      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "a. It does not matter which take-off technique is being used",

        "d. Yes, the chart has been made for this situation"
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "solution": "b",
      "explanation": "The performance charts in CAP 698 are based on the standard take-off technique where take-off power is set before brake release. If brakes are released before take-off power is set, the aircraft will have less acceleration and the accelerate-stop distance will be longer (worse) than shown in the chart, as the aircraft will be moving slower when the abort decision is made."

      "question": "When assessing obstacle clearance after take-off for a twin-engine Class B aircraft, the climb from 50 ft to 1500 ft:",
      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "a. is always assumed to take place with all engines operating",
        "b. assumes that an engine fails at the point where visual reference of the obstacle is lost",
        "c. always assumes that an engine has failed at 50 ft",
        "d. assumes that an engine fails at 400 ft above ground level"
      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "solution": "a",
      "explanation": "For obstacle clearance assessment in a twin-engine Class B aircraft, the climb from 50 ft (screen height) to 1500 ft is assumed to take place with all engines operating. This provides a conservative safety margin, as the actual climb performance will be better than the calculated performance if an engine fails during this phase."

      "question": "A light twin-engine aircraft is climbing from the screen height of 50 ft, and has an obstacle 10000 m along the net flight path. If the net climb gradient is 10%, there is no wind and the obstacle is 900 m above the aerodrome elevation then what will the clearance be?",
      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "a. The aircraft will not clear the object",
        "b. 85 m",
        "c. 100 m",
        "d. 115 m."
      ],
      "answer": "d",
      "solution": "d",
      "explanation": "Calculation: Net climb gradient = 10% = 0.10. Height gained over 10000 m = 10000 m × 0.10 = 1000 m. Starting height = 50 ft ≈ 15 m. Total height at obstacle = 15 m + 1000 m = 1015 m. Obstacle height = 900 m. Clearance = 1015 m - 900 m = 115 m."

        "d. 60 $m+0.125D$"
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "solution": "b",
      "explanation": "A multi-engine Class B aeroplane must clear obstacles in the take-off flight path by a minimum vertical margin of 50 ft (15.24 m). This is measured from the obstacle height to the lowest point of the aircraft's flight path."

      "question": "Regarding the take-off climb requirements for a multi-engine Class B aeroplane, what is the minimum all engine climb gradient after take-off?",

        "b. >0%",
        "c. 4%",
        "d. 2.4%"
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "solution": "b",
      "explanation": "For a multi-engine Class B aeroplane, the minimum all-engine climb gradient after take-off must be greater than 0%. This means the aircraft must be capable of climbing (positive climb gradient) with all engines operating. There is no specific minimum percentage requirement, only that it must be positive."

      "id": "11",
      "question": "If a multi-engine Class B aeroplane is unable to achieve the required vertical clearance over an obstacle, by what minimum horizontal margin must the obstacle be cleared? (assume wing span < 60 m.)",
      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "a. $60~m+1/2$ wingspan + 0.125D",
        "b. 90 $m+0.125D$",
        "c. $50~m/D+0.125$",
        "d. There is no minimum horizontal clearance requirement"
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "solution": "b",
      "explanation": "If a multi-engine Class B aeroplane cannot achieve the required vertical clearance (50 ft) over an obstacle, it must clear the obstacle by a minimum horizontal margin. For aircraft with wing span less than 60 m, the minimum horizontal clearance is 90 m + 0.125D, where D is the distance from the end of the take-off distance available to the obstacle."

      "question": "What is the maximum bank angle permitted within the take-off flight path up to 1500 ft for a multi-engine Class B aeroplane?",

        "d. $15^{\\circ}$"
      ],
      "answer": "d",
      "solution": "d",
      "explanation": "For a multi-engine Class B aeroplane, the maximum bank angle permitted within the take-off flight path up to 1500 ft is 15°. This limitation ensures that the aircraft maintains adequate climb performance and obstacle clearance during the initial climb phase."

      "id": "13",
      "question": "By what regulatory factor must the all engine climb gradient of a multi-engine Class B aeroplane be multiplied in order to comply with the obstacle clearance requirements?",
      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "a. 0.5%",
        "b. 0.5",
        "c. 0.77",
        "d. 1.43"
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "solution": "c",
      "explanation": "For obstacle clearance requirements, the all-engine climb gradient of a multi-engine Class B aeroplane must be multiplied by a factor of 0.77 to obtain the net climb gradient. This factor accounts for the reduction in climb performance that would occur if an engine fails, providing a safety margin for obstacle clearance calculations."
