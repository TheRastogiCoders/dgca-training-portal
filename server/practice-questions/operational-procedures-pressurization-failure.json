      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "A supply of oxygen sufficient for all crew and passengers to enable a shallow rate of descent to 10000 ft or 2 hours whichever is the longer",
        "A supply of oxygen for the crew only for the entire time the aeroplane cabin pressure is above 8000 ft",
        "A supply for all crew and passengers sufficient for a constant rate of descent from the aeroplane's maximum certificated operating altitude to 15000 ft in 10 minutes",
        "A supply for 10% of passengers whilst the cabin pressure is over 13000 ft"

      "question": "In a rapid or explosive decompression:",
      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "the cabin pressure control system immediately reduces the cabin pressure to ambient pressure to prevent the fuselage integrity being destroyed",
        "the cabin altitude quickly or instantaneously reduces to ambient (outside) pressure",
        "the cause of the decompression is usually catastrophic failure of the pressure hull",
        "cabin pressurization system failure will be the first indication that something is wrong"

      "options": [
        "a rapid decompression will be immediately noticeable, a slow decompression will require instrumentation to detect the failure",
        "a rapid decompression is caused by a pressure hull rupture whereas a slow decompression is caused by system failure",
        "the rate at which the cabin altitude climbs with respect to the desired climb setting or the automatic control setting",
        "the speed with which the cabin altitude rises with respect to the ambient (outside) pressure"

      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "the cabin temperature will fall as the pressure reduces",
        "body cavities (sinuses, ears etc.) will become pressurized and may require assistance in venting",
        "as soon as the pressure falls, the oxygen drop-out system will operate",

        "immediately commence a diversion to a suitable alternate",
        "increase engine power to provide additional airflow to the pressurization systems",
        "maintain the aeroplane attitude to prevent further damage to the airframe by over loading of the structure",
