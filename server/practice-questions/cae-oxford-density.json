      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "a. Because air density increases with decrease of temperature, air density must increase with increase of height in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)",
        "b. At any given surface temperature the air density will be greater in anticyclonic conditions than it will be when the MSL pressure is lower",
        "c. Air density increases with increase of relative humidity",
        "d. The effect of change of temperature on the air density is much greater than the effect of change of atmospheric pressure"
