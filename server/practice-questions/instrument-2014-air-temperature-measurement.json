    {
      "id": "1",
      "question": "The difference between static air temperature and total air temperature is known as:",
      "options": [
        "a. corrected outside air temperature",
        "b. the total ram rise",
        "c. the recovery factor",
        "d. hot ramp radiation"
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The difference between static air temperature (SAT) and total air temperature (TAT) is called the ram rise, which occurs due to kinetic heating when air is brought to rest."

    {
      "id": "2",
      "question": "A direct reading aircraft thermometer usually consists of a bimetallic helix protruding into the airstream. Movement of the pointer over the temperature scale will depend upon:",
      "options": [
        "a. difference in electrical resistance of the two metals",
        "b. increase in pressure as airspeed increases",
        "c. increase in adiabatic cooling as airspeed increases",
        "d. different coefficients of expansion of the two metals"
      ],
      "answer": "d",
      "explanation": "A bimetallic thermometer uses two metals with different coefficients of thermal expansion. As temperature changes, the helix bends, moving the pointer."

      "id": "3",
      "question": "A remote reading thermometer depends on ______ to indicate changes in temperature:",
      "options": [
        "a. change of electrical resistance of the two metals",
        "b. change of electrical resistance with temperature",
        "c. change of electrical resistance with pressure",
        "d. change of electrical capacitance with temperature"
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Remote reading thermometers use temperature-sensitive resistors (thermistors or RTDs) whose electrical resistance changes with temperature."

    {
      "id": "4",
      "question": "Aircraft air temperature thermometers are shielded to protect them from:",
      "options": [
        "a. solar radiation",
        "b. accidental physical damage on the ground or hailstones in flight",
        "c. airframe icing",
        "d. kinetic heating"
      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Temperature probes are shielded to prevent direct solar radiation from heating the sensor and giving false high readings."

    {
      "id": "5",
      "question": "At a true airspeed of 500 knots, what is the ram rise?",
      "options": [
        "a. $50^{\\circ}C$",
        "b. $25^{\\circ}C$",
        "c. $5^{\\circ}C$",
        "d. $16^{\\circ}C$"
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Ram rise is approximately (TAS/100)² in degrees Celsius. For 500 knots: (500/100)² = 25°C."
    },
    {
      "id": "6",
      "question": "An air temperature probe may be aspirated in order to:",
      "options": [
        "a. prevent icing",
        "b. measure air temperature on the ground",
        "c. compensate for moisture level at the ramp position",
        "d. reduce the effects of solar radiation"
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Aspirated probes use a fan or pump to draw air through the sensor, ensuring accurate readings when the aircraft is stationary on the ground with no airflow."
    },
    {
      "id": "7",
      "question": "Total Air Temperature is:",
      "options": [
        "a. the maximum temperature attainable by the air when brought to rest adiabatically",
        "b. the temperature indicated on the air temperature thermometer plus the ram rise",
        "c. the static air temperature minus the recovery factor",
        "d. the recovery factor plus the ram rise"
      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Total Air Temperature (TAT) is the theoretical maximum temperature the air would reach if brought to rest adiabatically (without heat loss), including kinetic heating."
    },
    {
      "id": "8",
      "question": "Which of these formulae gives the total temperature $(T_{t})$ from the static temperature (T):",
      "options": [
        "a. $T_{t}=T_{s}(1+0.2~M^{2})$",
        "b. $T_{t}=\\dot{T}_{s}(1+0.2~K_{r}M^{2})$",
        "c. $T_{t}=T_{s}^{2}/(1+0.2K_{r}M^{2})$",
        "d. $T_{t}=T_{5}^{\\circ}(1-0.2M^{2})^{\\circ}$"
      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "The correct formula for total temperature is Tt = Ts(1 + 0.2M²), where Ts is static temperature and M is Mach number. This accounts for adiabatic compression heating."
