      "question": "For a single-engine Class B aeroplane, how does runway slope affect allowable take-off mass, assuming other factors remain constant and not limiting?",
      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "a. An uphill slope decreases take-off mass",
        "b. Allowable take-off mass is not affected by runway slope",
        "c. A downhill slope decreases allowable take-off mass",
        "d. A downhill slope increases allowable take-off mass"
      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "solution": "a",
      "explanation": "An uphill runway slope increases the component of weight acting against the take-off direction, requiring more thrust to accelerate. This reduces the allowable take-off mass because the aeroplane needs more runway distance or cannot achieve the required take-off performance with the same mass."
