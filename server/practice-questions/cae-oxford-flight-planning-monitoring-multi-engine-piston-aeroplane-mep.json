      "question": "Refer to CAP 697, MEP, Fig 3.1.\nA flight is to be made from an airfield (elevation 3000 ft) to another. The cruising level is FL120, temp ISA. The OAT at the departure airfield is +10°C, the wind component in the climb is +30 kt.\nCalculate the fuel used, time and distance flown in the climb.",

      "answer": "Answer requires CAP 697, MEP, Fig 3.1",
      "solution": "Answer requires CAP 697, MEP, Fig 3.1",
      "explanation": "This question requires reference to CAP 697 MEP, Figure 3.1 to calculate climb performance including fuel consumption, time, and distance (NGM - Nautical Ground Miles) for the specified departure elevation, cruise level, temperature conditions, and wind component."
