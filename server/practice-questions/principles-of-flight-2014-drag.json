  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "pof2014-5-1",
      "question": "What is the effect on total drag of an aircraft if the airspeed decreases in level flight below that speed for maximum L/D?",
      "options": [
        "Drag increases because of increased induced drag.",
        "Drag decreases because of lower induced drag.",
        "Drag increases because of increased parasite drag.",
        "Drag decreases because of lower parasite drag."
      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Below best L/D speed the wing must produce more lift coefficient, raising induced drag and total drag."
    },
    {
      "id": "pof2014-5-2",
      "question": "By changing the angle of attack of a wing, the pilot can control the aeroplane's:",
      "options": [
        "lift and airspeed, but not drag.",
        "lift, gross weight, and drag.",
        "lift, airspeed, and drag.",
        "lift and drag, but not airspeed."
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Angle of attack adjustments simultaneously influence lift, associated drag, and consequently the airspeed needed to balance thrust."
    },
    {
      "id": "pof2014-5-3",
      "question": "What is the relationship between induced and parasite drag when the gross weight is increased?",
      "options": [
        "Parasite drag increases more than induced drag.",
        "Induced drag increases more than parasite drag.",
        "Both parasite and induced drag are equally increased.",
        "Both parasite and induced drag are equally decreased."
      ],
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "A heavier aircraft must generate more lift, raising angle of attack and induced drag significantly while parasite drag changes relatively little."
    },
    {
      "id": "pof2014-5-4",
      "question": "In theory, if the airspeed of an aeroplane is doubled while in level flight, parasite drag will become:",
      "options": [
        "twice as great.",
        "half as great.",
        "four times greater.",
        "one quarter as much."
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "Parasite drag varies with the square of speed; doubling speed multiplies parasite drag by four."
    },
    {
      "id": "pof2014-5-5",
      "question": "As airspeed decreases in level flight below that speed for maximum lift/drag ratio, total drag of an aeroplane:",
      "options": [
        "increases because induced drag rises rapidly.",
        "decreases because parasite drag continues to reduce.",
        "remains constant because the reduction in parasite drag equals the increase in induced drag.",
        "decreases only if thrust is reduced."
      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Moving left of best L/D causes induced drag to dominate and total drag climbs even though parasite drag falls."
