    "question": "What is the effect of airwash on airspeed indicators?",
    "answer": "Airwash can cause airspeed indicators to read inaccurately, typically showing higher than actual airspeed due to the increased dynamic pressure from propeller wash or jet exhaust.",

    "question": "Explain the relationship between pressure gradient and wind speed.",
    "answer": "Wind speed is directly proportional to the pressure gradient. A steeper pressure gradient (closer isobars) results in stronger winds, while a weak gradient (widely spaced isobars) produces light winds.",
